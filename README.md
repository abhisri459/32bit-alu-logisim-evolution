# 32bit-alu-logisim-evolution

32 bit Arithemetic Logic Unit in Logisim Evolution with test vectors.

Use  of  Logisim  simulator  to  construct  your 32-bit  Arithmetic  Logic  Unit (ALU). Your ALU must support following twos complement arithmetic and logic operations: ▪Arithmeticoperations [Range extension, Negation, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication   (using   Booth's   algorithm), Division   (using   restoring approach)]
▪Logic operations [AND, OR, NOT]
Generate  3-bit  operation  code  to  produce  8  combinations  for  8  operations (NEG,  ADD,  SUB,  MUL,  DIV,  AND,  OR,  NOT),  which  is to  be used by controllogic to control different components.Input: two 32-bit binary numbersOutput: One 32/64-bit binary number, Flag bits (Carry, Overflow, Sign, Zero)
